## 🌟 Features

- 🔒 **Secure Browser-Based Processing** - All operations happen locally in your browser

- 🎨 **Modern UI/UX** - Beautiful, responsive design with smooth animations
- 🔍 **Easy to Use** - Simple drag-and-drop interface for image uploads

## 🚀 Quick Start

Visit [steg.fun](https://steg.fun) and start hiding messages! Or run it locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/debugdotdog/steg.fun

# Start with Docker
docker-compose up -d

# Visit http://localhost:8000
```

## 🔍 How It Works

steg.fun uses LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography to hide messages in images:

1. 📸 Upload any image
2. ✍️ Type your secret message
3. 🎭 Click "Hide Message"
4. 📥 Download your encoded image
5. 🔓 Share it with anyone who needs to read the hidden message

The changes to the image are imperceptible to the human eye, but contain your secret message!

## 🛡️ Security Note

- All processing happens locally in your browser
- No data is ever transmitted to any server
- Images and messages stay on your device
- For sensitive data, consider additional encryption
